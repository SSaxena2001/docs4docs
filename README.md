## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

We focus on dealing with problems faced by people in there day to day life regarding there health and how at times our busy schedule makes us ignore our health, Patients who are ill, suffering from any mental disorder, people who need a therapist or someone consultant can use our app and see the change in thier life.

People who are unable to find doctor who can help them, patients who lack the confidence to face the truth, or even in times when you need a second opinion you can connect to your own personal doctor and discuss with them. Doctors who are available near you can provide you with medicine, opinion and help that you were looking for.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Our app can provide doctors who are available to help the patient with thier needs, They can chat with each other or do a video call and can examine the patient and prescribe him with medicine, opinion in terms of surgery and so. 

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- One of the biggest problems is starting the peerjs connection again and again when ever video chat option is choosen 
- Availability of doctors is determined by doctor himself, reaching out to doctors near the patient is a tedious task. 


## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

We'll be making a fully managable app where we can have doctors interacting with multiple patients, consultants and therapists available for each patient, patients can choose multiple doctors for advise in various fields and a better design implementation

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

- Run the server and open localhost:3000 on the browser using the following command:

  ```
